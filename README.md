# What is Docker?
###   Docker is a powerful open-source platform for developing, deploying, and running applications using containers. It allows you to package your code and its dependencies into standardized units called containers, which are lightweight and portable. 

### Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service specifically designed for storing and sharing Docker images. It acts as a central repository where you can find, download, and even push your own Docker images.
